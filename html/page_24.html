Student\/faculty research opportunities in Computer Science have been enriched with involved faculty, including Xunfei Jiang&#039;s work on power saving scheduling algorithms and Charlie Peck work with students on field science projects. Our Green Science group designed and built our first solar charging station. Now anyone in the community can charge their devices using solar energy! Given Earlham\u2019s globally diverse community, most students don\u2019t even have to leave campus in order to converse with native speakers in the languages they are studying. Highlights Earlham has three new Applied Science Groups: Disaster Preparation and Response, Fabrication Lab (3D design and printing), and Cluster System Administration. Our majors have pursued graduate work in computer science at institutions such as Indiana University; University of California, Santa Cruz; and the universities of Central Florida, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Oregon, Pittsburgh, Toronto, and Washington. Alumni have found jobs with such major technology companies as Lucent, Amazon.com, Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft, MCI\/WorldCom, and Ontrack. Others have started their own technology businesses. Standardized Test Scores Standardized test scores are required of all international applicants. If English is not your primary language, you must submit an English Proficiency exam and meet the required criteria. You may also submit an SAT or ACT score to enhance your competitiveness for admission and for scholarship consideration. If English is your primary language, you may submit your SAT or ACT scores instead of an English Proficiency exam. Current accepted tests and minimum required scores are: Test Required Recommended SAT \u2013 EBRW 400 600 ACT \u2013 Reading 20 26 TOEFL - total 80 92 IELTS \u2013 total 6.0 7.0 Duolingo - total 105 115 GTEC - total 1192 1255 ISE - total ISE II Merit ISE III Pass While we understand the many issues present in standardized testing, Earlham\u2019s current registration with SEVIS requires compliance with these test score requirements. SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System used by the Department of State on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (in other words, important US governmental agencies). Therefore, the International Student Advisers must use test scores to substantiate academic preparedness and English proficiency when preparing an I-20 (the document needed to apply for a student visa) for an admitted student.&quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;Built-in 2015, the Center for Science and Technology includes a state-of-the-art computer lab and a robotics lab, supporting both what we teach and how we teach it.&quot;,&quot;description_html&quot;:&quot;Overview Built-in 2015, the Center for Science and Technology includes a state-of-the-art computer lab and a robotics lab, supporting both what we teach and how we teach it.

The rapid advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have far-reaching impacts on our lives, ranging from mobile apps, smart home systems and health-monitoring devices to industrial process optimisation. AI is intimately linked to physics in various ways, and seamless collaboration between physics and AI enables accurate observations of the environment and the realistic formulation of solutions. Physics principles can be deployed to optimise AI components, facilitating the discoveries of critical workflows and parameters, as well as enhancing the training of AI systems. Conversely, AI plays a pivotal role in modern physics research by rapidly screening potential solutions, thereby saving resources needed for experimental studies.

It is concerned with the theory of algorithms (that is, effective procedures or programs), with the structure of languages for the expression of algorithms, and with the design of algorithms for the solution of practical problems. A central concern is a study of the computer systems (hardware and software) for the automatic execution of these algorithms. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Denver offers a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The degree is strongly based on mathematics and, in fact, a student will automatically acquire sufficient credits for a minor in mathematics. One additional minor is required. The second minor may be in any discipline other than mathematics or computer science. Total Credit Hours 183 quarter hours. HONORS &amp;amp; DISTINCTIONS Make the most of your undergraduate experience in a stimulating academic and social community. When you&#039;re accepted into the University Honors Program, you&#039;ll enjoy the small classes and close community of a private college along with the opportunities and resources of a research university. STUDY ABROAD Ranked in the top five for the number of undergraduates studying abroad, the University of Denver is known for the impact its students make internationally. At the Department of Computer Science, we share the university\u2019s commitment to international learning and strongly encourage our students to participate in Study Abroad programs. Cherrington Global Scholars Program Through the Cherrington Global Scholars Program, the University\u2019s primary Study Abroad program, you can study abroad for about the same cost as a term at DU. Plan your study abroad experience carefully. Here are a few things to consider: The computer science department curriculum has been designed for you to complete your studies in 4 years. To remain on the four-year graduation path, you will need to be \u201con track\u201d with your degree program at the time you leave for study abroad and you may need to study at an institution that offers equivalent courses. The institutions that offer the required courses are limited, vary depending on the degree and may change from one year to the next. For more information about the Cherrington Global Scholar Program, contact your academic advisor. TRANSFER STUDENTS We welcome transfer students at the School of Engineering and Computer Science and have many students who have come to us from schools in the U.S. and abroad. First Step Visit the undergraduate transfer student website and review the standards for admission as well as the DU Transfer Matrix. The matrix and review of the admissions standards will help you with a smooth 2+2 academic transfer plan from any of the Colorado Community Colleges. Second Step Schedule meetings with transfer admissions and computer science department representatives to talk about your specific interests. They will give you further information on the transfer process and requirements.&quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;Computer Science encompasses the theory and techniques by which information is encoded, stored, communicated, transformed, and analyzed.
