<div><save-program :program="{&quot;school_title&quot;:&quot;York St John University&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;BSc in Computer Science&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;In a world where computation devices are becoming ever more central to political, economic and social cohesion it is logical that the activities of computer scientists will come to play an ever-increasing role in defining the society of tomorrow. With this comes the recognition that technical decisions regarding software and hardware development are also ethical, political and philosophical decisions since the deployment of both hardware and software plays an increasing role in dictating how we interface with and understand ourselves both individually and as a society. Computer Science at York St John University is committed to developing employable graduates with technical, professional and entrepreneurial skills that contemporary organisations need to contend with this new emerging reality.

Computer Systems Fundamentals: This module will provide you with a broader understanding of the infrastructure of a computer. It covers basic issues in hardware and operating systems and focuses on commonly available desktop computer systems. The aim is to widen your exposure to the computer systems; covering widely used operating systems in the industry to support software engineering and the Internet. Programming 2: This module will introduce you to Object Orientated Programming in the context of software development. Ideas of problem-solving through programming and algorithm design are further developed, building on semester one modules. You will learn how to edit, compile, run and test programmes of increasing complexity in procedural and object-orientated languages. Software Engineering: You will develop a basic understanding of the fundamental techniques of software engineering by focusing on the design and realisation of a web-based artefact. The module will emphasise the acquisition of an appropriate balance of software engineering knowledge and the skills necessary to design a web-based artefact. Technology in Context: This module is to introduce core skills required of a computing professional as well as fundamental discursive skills for considering and evaluating the wider philosophical implications of current and emerging computing practices, The module will comprise of information gathering, analysis, discursive debate and presentation. It will introduce you to the relevant professional aspects of computing practice and their wider social ramifications. This includes the role of professional bodies, plus the legal, ethical and social aspects of computing. Level 2 Level 2 will enable you to further develop your subject knowledge through modules in networking, databases and mobile application development. Coupled with these you will undertake a professional project allowing you to apply your skills in a \u2018live\u2019 setting, working for an established company or undertaking a self-initiated, possibly collaborative, entrepreneurial project. This opportunity will enable you to apply and test the knowledge you\u2019ve acquired so far through your degree, affirming your learning through real-world experience. At level 2 you will also undertake the Philosophies of Technology module which will enhance your knowledge of current relevant subject discourses and qualitative and quantitative research methods preparing you for your major project at level 3. Teaching at this level will incorporate all the previous modes at level 1, but with an emphasis on more self-directed and group project-based work. Modules Modules include: Programming 3: This module develops your programming skills by exposing you to intermediate and advanced programming concepts and methods. Combining formal methods from software engineering with practical software development tasks, you will enhance, evolve, test and consolidate your programming skills, through a series of lecture and practice-based labs. Databases and Networks: The aim of this module is to introduce and explore the essential principles and concepts of databases and networks. You will gain practical experience of designing, implementing and managing database systems, as well as the technical detail that underpins the operation of networked and internetworked systems. Software Engineering: Design Patterns: This module will introduce the structure of object-oriented systems, covering both design and programming. It is based around the notion of a design pattern: an abstraction of a proven solution to a recurring problem in a particular context in system structure and behaviour. Mobile Application Development: This module aims to give you a comprehensive understanding of the technologies used for developing applications for mobile computing devices. It will explore the characteristics of mobile devices and how they affect software engineering decisions; preparing you to work in the area of mobile and ubiquitous software development. Professional Project: The growing focus on work-related learning reflects a clear understanding and appreciation of the relationship between technical knowledge of an area and the need for computing and employability skills. This module provides you with an opportunity to experience work-related learning through a range of self-initiated options including self-initiated or collaborative entrepreneurial projects or working with businesses to develop computer-based solutions to real-world problems. Philosophies of Technology: This module exposes you to key philosophical discourses significant to their field of study e.g., ethics, ontology, aesthetics, sustainability, ecology of technical systems, post-humanism and virtuality. Through exposure to these discourses, you will be encouraged to reflect upon and evaluate the wider ramifications of computer science within a social and political context. Level 3 Level 3 includes advanced modules in your field, allowing you to specialise and accent your learning via a choice of optional modules, for example: Cybercrime Security, Software Solutions for Business, Advanced Web Development, Data Visualisation and iOS Games Development. The specific optional modules offered each year will vary based on student numbers and available resources thus not all listed modules may be available each year. Accompanying this you will undertake a major year-long independent research project of your own design, agreed by and supported by an academic supervisor. This project may be in any existing or emerging field of software engineering research. You are encouraged to consolidate your technical learning and professional research interests through this major project. Teaching and learning at level 3 again incorporates the modes of delivery and activity encountered at levels 1 and 2, however, the emphasis at level 3 is on independent self-directed work that responds to learning within and across modules. Modules Compulsory modules include: Major Project: The aim of this module is to give you the opportunity to bring together the theoretical understanding and the practical skills you will have acquired from other modules. The projects typically involve producing a software product from conceptualisation through to successful evaluation and the production of a well crafted, substantial report to demonstrate the output of the research. Human-Computer Interaction: This module is concerned with designing, evaluating and deploying usable, effective and interactive technologies. The aim of this module is to allow you to focus on key areas, approaches and developments in the field of the user experience. Internet of Things: The Internet of Things is a term used to describe an internet comprised of networked objects. The term incorporates but is not limited to concepts of ubiquitous computing; ambient intelligence; Machine to Machine communication (M2M). What unites these discourses is the question of how the deployment of \u2018smart\u2019 technology in public and social spaces will affect not only how we relate to each other but also how we understand ourselves as human beings. This module seeks to open up these questions for exploration through a practical project developing Internet of Things technology for deployment in public and\/or social contexts. Optional modules include: Cybercrime Security: Cyber terrorism has been and continues to be a major concern. Thus, cybercrime security has evolved as an interdisciplinary field that seeks to address the ever-increasing use of computing technology in criminal activities. Practitioners face the challenge of understanding the complex nature of the field, its associated technologies, and the principles and practices of the criminal investigation. Focusing primarily on the software aspects of this field, this module provides you with the opportunity to be equipped with the skill set required the assist in the investigation of crime involving the use of digital equipment using legally accepted methods and tools. Advanced Web Development: This module focuses on the use of advanced and professional web technologies that enable more interactivity, dynamism, accessible, usable and easy to manage complex web applications. Technologies such as advanced features of CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, DOM, PHP and AJAX will be covered including knowledge of how to configure and maintain web servers \u2013 such as Apache. The module will also cover more advanced programming techniques associated with web applications. Data Visualisation: The aim of this module is to introduce the principles and techniques involved in the displaying of data to provide greater insight into the information contained within the data.

Entrepreneurship @ LIU Entrepreneurial thinkers create value in society using innovation under conditions of uncertainty. The ability to think entrepreneurially is critical for all students, regardless of their major or their career plans. The entrepreneurship program at LIU Brooklyn is designed to engage students to think entrepreneurially while they learn how to execute on their vision efficiently and effectively. The entrepreneurial process requires students to ask tough questions about the nature of their venture using skills developed throughout the business core. What are the benefits of the product or service and how is it differentiated from the competition? What is the target market and how will it be penetrated? How will the product or service be produced? What personnel are required and how will they be managed? What are the risks of the venture and what can be done to reduce them? What are the financial implications of the plan? What resources, including funding, are required? The best way to understand the entrepreneurial process is to take a hands-on, experiential approach. In this major, students will interact extensively with the business community both inside and outside the classroom and produce a plan that is both defensible to potential investors and actionable in the real world. There are three ways to study entrepreneurship at LIU Brooklyn. At the undergraduate level, there is a major and a minor available. Student Associations, Organizations &amp;amp; Club The School of Business, Public Administration and Information Sciences has a number of student associations, organizations, and clubs that students can join. These groups provide students with the opportunity to meet and to network with other students, faculty members, and professionals who share similar interests. They foster personal and professional growth and leadership opportunities outside of the classroom and are wonderful additions to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. This Web page provides a broad overview of each group. We urge students to get involved with the group that relates to their career path. Those students who have yet to choose a major can also become involved in these student associations, organizations or clubs to explore various career paths in the School of Business, Public Administration and Information Sciences.&quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;The 120-credit B.S. in Computer Science degree focuses on the concepts and techniques used in the design and the development of advanced software systems, network designs, and applications.

Computer science is not just programming and study of computers, but rather is about problem-solving \u2013 the study of algorithms and information representation to make productive use of computing technologies. Computer science is a young but fast-growing discipline. Its importance is evident in the profound impact that the use of computers has on our lives. Computer science education is now as indispensable as any of the traditional programmes in any established university. Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science) The BEng(CompSc) programme is a programme that offers a solid education in the fundamental and essential areas of computing. It is a timely and practical curriculum that is essential for aspiring students and future IT professionals. Upon completion of this curriculum, students will be well-equipped with both basic and advanced knowledge in computer science, which aims to better prepare students to launch their career in the IT industry and\/or to pursue postgraduate studies in this area. Highlights of the Programme Flexibility \u2013 Students can select electives from a wide variety of courses and use them as credits for a second major, a minor, double minors or the double-degree programme. Accreditation \u2013 The programme is accredited by the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE). Internship \u2013 Students normally spend eight to twelve weeks of paid work experience and professional development in the industry during the summer after the third year, or they can join the Integrated Study-Work programme to get one-year work experience. Final year project \u2013 Students may choose amongst research-based projects, software development projects, and industry-based projects as their Capstone Experience. Go on an exchange \u2013 Students may join the Exchange Programme to study in a foreign university for one semester or one year. Research opportunity \u2013 Outstanding students are having the opportunities to undertake research under the University Research Fellowship Programme. Programme Structure To obtain the BEng(CompSc) degree, you need to pass at least 240 credits of courses in the following categories: Component Types University Requirements (UG5) University Common Core courses English courses Chinese course Specialization \u2013 Computer Science General Engineering courses CS Introductory courses CS Advanced courses CS Elective courses Capstone Experience Experiential Learning Electives Elective courses General Engineering courses To prepare students with the necessary background to pursue any of the majors in the engineering programme; including mathematics, physics, computer programming, and general engineering courses. CS Introductory courses CS Advanced courses Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms Computer Organization Discrete Mathematics Object-oriented Programming and Java Principles of Operating Systems Computer and Communication Networks Design and Analysis of Algorithms Introduction to Database Management Systems Introduction to Software Engineering Capstone Experience Experiential Learning Final Year Project Internship Options Minor(s) or Second Major Students may opt for a minor or double minor or a 2nd major in another discipline such as Finance, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, or Risk Management. The requirement for obtaining a minor is to complete 6 to 8 courses of the corresponding discipline; and for 2nd major, it\u2019s 12 to 16 courses. However, students may not be allowed to take a 2nd major which requires more than 90 credits as he\/she may not be able to complete the BEng(CompSc) programme in 4 years. Double-Degree BEng\/BBA Students may opt for the double-degree programme by taking a BEng degree in the first four years of study with some required business courses, and a BBA degree in the fifth year which is run on a self-financed basis. Admission Requirements Students seeking admission to the BEng(CompSc) programme have to apply for entry under the Faculty of Engineering Common Admissions Scheme, which allows applicants to use one single code, JS6963, to apply for the 9 BEng programmes. A quota of 140+ will be imposed for BEng programmes offered by each department of the Faculty of Engineering. Students can choose their desired study programme after their first year of study, on the basis of academic performance. JUPAS Applicants In addition to the University general entrance requirements, applicants with HKDSE qualification are required to fulfill the following programme entrance requirements: (HKU general entrance requirements: https:\/\/aal.hku.hk\/admissions\/) Non-JUPAS Applicants Applicants with other qualifications, such as HKALE, GCSE, IB, Associate Degree, and Higher Diploma, and Mainland students will be considered on an individual merit basis. More details are available at the HKU Admission website: https:\/\/aal.hku.hk\/admissions\/ Career Prospects Our graduates work as IT professionals in different sectors of society, say banking &amp;amp; finance, the government, education, IT &amp;amp; telecommunication, etc. Many of them are now working in leading international companies and even work abroad with big names, such as Apple and Google. Some graduates started their own business and be an entrepreneur. Alternatively, they can pursue a master or doctoral degree in HK or overseas. Our graduates are welcome by institutions worldwide. Computer Science graduates are very employable, not just for IT jobs but for other analytical roles too. The problem-solving skills and analytical abilities that our graduates develop during their undergraduate study proved to be very valuable in many areas of endeavor. Internship Opportunities The BEng(CompSc) programme requires students to undertake at least 4 weeks of industrial training in the summer after their third year of study for gaining some real-world working experience in the industry. This period of training brings many benefits. For example, the relevant working experience gives students a distinct advantage when they look for graduate employment. Employers often invite their interns to continue working beyond the summer as part-time staff. In many cases, this leads to the offer of a full-time position upon graduation.
