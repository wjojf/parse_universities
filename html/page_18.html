<div><save-program :program="{&quot;school_title&quot;:&quot;University of Westminster&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Software Engineering BEng Honours&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Course summary This course studies the best ways to design, build, maintain and evaluate software systems. It uses many of the technical aspects of computer science, especially programming, and aims to develop the professional attitudes, interpersonal and technical skills you will need in the software engineering industry. The course provides a solid foundation in software engineering theory and practice to develop professional software systems. It will equip you to take up a wide range of career opportunities, including software engineer, web application programmer, software designer\/analyst or website designer\/programmer. You will study software development, programming languages, technologies and applications including Java, C\/C#, UNIX, UML, graphics, networks, concurrent systems, databases, artificial intelligence, and web and mobile computing. You will share a common first year with the Computer Science BSc Honours course; you can transfer in Year 1, and specialise in Year 3. The Software Engineering BEng emphasises fundamental principles, design, acquisition of practical skills and evaluation of technologies. You may go on to complete an integrated Masters programme with the award of an MEng degree after four years. Professional accreditation This programme is accredited by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, for fully meeting the educational requirement for Chartered IT Professional (CITP) status and for partially satisfying the underpinning knowledge requirements set by the Engineering Council in the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC) and the Science Council for Chartered or Incorporated Engineer (CEng or IEng) status as well as for Chartered Scientist (CSci) status. Note that there are additional requirements, including work experience, to achieve full CITP, CEng, CSci or IEng status. Graduates of this accredited degree will also be eligible for professional membership of BCS (MBCS). The BCS accreditation is an indicator of the programme\u2019s quality to students and employers; it is also an important benchmark of the programme\u2019s standard in providing high-quality computing education, and commitment to developing future IT professionals that have the potential to achieve Chartered status. The programme is also likely to be recognised by other countries that are signatories to international accords. &quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;This course studies the best ways to design, build, maintain and evaluate software systems.

This course builds on more than ten years of experience in education in network design and support, and its aim is to produce network engineers with a strong background in security. The course focuses on three main aspects \u2013 communication, network design and implementation, and security. You will develop the knowledge and technical expertise to be able to take on specific responsibility within a network team or as a team leader for the security aspects of that network, particularly in industries such as banking, where security is crucially important. Our graduates have also gone on to work for organisations such as BT, HP, Cisco, Dell, Google Enterprise, Huawei Technologies and Quinix, as well as for smaller private companies. Westminster is a Cisco Networking Academy, and the course incorporates the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Security curriculum, giving you the opportunity to complete the CCNA Security qualification while studying for your degree.

Our BSc Computer Science course will provide you with a solid foundation for designing the next generation of computational systems. It will also enable you to analyse and resolve issues with today\u2019s software programs. You\u2019ll be taught by academics at the forefront of their field and have opportunities to attend lectures from industry experts. What you will study Our BSc Computer Science course will develop your understanding of the concepts and principles that form the basis of computing systems. We\u2019ll provide you with the balance of knowledge and skills you need to design, implement and troubleshoot software and complex systems to a professional standard. In the last year of this programme, you will conduct a\u00a0final year project that will\u00a0allow you to\u00a0develop\u00a0transferrable skills, such as independent research, presentation and time management.\u00a0 You may choose to take a Professional Training placement year, which will give you invaluable industry experience and opportunities to apply theory to real-world scenarios. You\u2019ll explore a wide range of topics including object-oriented programming, artificial intelligence, computer security and computational mathematics. This will involve using languages and tools such as Java, C++, Android, SQL, Python, MATLAB and assembler, and specialist hardware such as Arduino microcontrollers. \u201cSelf-learning is a key skill in growing as a developer and the Final Year Project develops\u00a0your ability to work independently and produce a result which you then present\u00a0at a professional standard \u2013 which is very similar to how a product is delivered.\u201d Emma Jeyarajah, student \&quot;For me, doing\u00a0a summer internship has shaped my career aspirations.

Placements You have the option to complete a Professional Training placement as part of this course. This will give you the opportunity to develop your professional, academic and personal potential, helping to prepare you for your future career. A significant proportion of placement students at Surrey are offered graduate-level jobs or go onto postgraduate study. Computer Science placements Many computer science students continue working with their placement employers by basing their final-year project on work related to their placement. This results in a project with a strong industrial focus that can demonstrate their ability to apply their academic knowledge to real-world problems. The Professional Training placement year counts towards the experience required for professional membership of the British Computer Society (BCS). Our students take up placements at a wide range of companies, with recent examples including: Accenture Microsoft Eli Lilly and Company BAE Systems Detica Sky TV Xceptor Sony Europe Ltd Avco Systems Ltd Nintendo of Europe GmbH IBM Cisco Systems Ltd \&quot;Since starting here I feel I\u2019ve learnt to work effectively under pressure by prioritising my work, and have tremendously improved my communication and interpersonal skills which I\u2019ll hopefully continue to do so in the future too.\u201d Manisha Sen, student Study and work abroad We give our students the opportunity to acquire international experience during their studies\u00a0by taking advantage of our exchange agreements with overseas universities or by completing a Professional Training placement abroad. Want to study at an overseas institution as part of your degree or work abroad during your Professional Training year? Perhaps you would like to volunteer in India or learn about Brazilian business and culture in S\u00e3o Paulo during your summer holidays? With more than\u00a0200 partnerships, from 50 different countries worldwide, there is something for everyone. Not only is the opportunity to go abroad a hugely enjoyable experience, but you will also develop key skills and knowledge that will strengthen your CV and increase your employability. Please note: the status of the Erasmus+ scheme is dependent on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. You may wish to spend your Professional Training year working in another country. Students on this course have worked at Movilitas in Germany, Pfizer in the US or Yokogawa Europe in the Netherlands.

The aim of the bachelor program Computer Science is the education of graduates with a broad knowledge in two areas. The first area of gained expertise is applied computer science, in particular the ability to analyze and program real-world problems, which enables the graduates to get jobs in the industry directly after finishing their bachelor&#039;s degree. The second area is theoretical computer science (including a relatively broad mathematical foundation), which enables the graduates to continue their studies on a master (and later possibly also a doctoral) level. The coverage of both above-mentioned areas is in an accord with the position of computer science on the borderline between technical and natural sciences. The study program Computer Science has three specializations. One of them is more practically oriented (Databases and web) and two are more theoretically focused (General computer science, Artificial intelligence). The first year of study is common for all three specializations, which allows students to pick their specializations as late as in the second year of study when they have enough information for such a decision. An important part of the study program is creative work, which includes student theses. This type of work is aimed at software and specialized hardware development (in the applied area of computer science), and at scientific publications (in the theoretical area of computer science).
