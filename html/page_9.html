Computer science is a science that has both a technical and scientific character. If it were to be considered whether the dominant role in this area is played by theory or practice, it should be said that theory serves practice. Specializations Graphics and multimedia The graduate of the specialization has a professionally certified IT engineer title confirmed with a diploma. The diploma is based on the results of learning in the range of knowledge, skills and attitudes defined on the basis of national and European professional qualification frameworks, which provide the qualifications and authorization to pursue a profession of an IT specialist in various positions requiring general and specialized knowledge and the ability to extend and improve professional qualifications on consequent education levels (supplementing master\u2019s studies) and specialist courses on specific technologies and their applications in business and offices. Databases and Business Intelligence Studies with a specialization in databases and business intelligence prepare graduates to work in IT companies, consulting and analytical firms. The acquired knowledge and skills enable to work in Data Mining Centers, in MS SQL-based data wholesalers as a supporter developer, as an analyst in Business Intelligence. Knowledge of programming languages makes it possible to work as a Java programmer. Knowledge of tools and processes supporting the reporting process in Business Intelligence enables to work as a specialist for business applications tailored the needs of the business clients. Programming and web technologies Studies with a specialization in programming and web technologies prepare graduates to design IT systems. Apart from stand-alone type applications, graduates are prepared to develop dispersed applications, especially web applications. The graduate of this specialization has the knowledge necessary to create a fully functional website, starting with XHTML and computer graphics, through advanced multi-layered techniques using platforms such as Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) and Microsoft.NET. He can design databases and knows object-oriented mapping techniques (ORM). Networks and information security Studies with a specialization in \u201ecomputer networks and information security\u201d prepare graduates in the area of design, implementation and operation of network operating systems (MS Windows, Linux\/UNIX) and LAN and WAN computer networks, as well as their management, with particular emphasis on their security. A future IT engineer will get to know modern methods of securing and authenticating access to information resources, he will also be able to gain certifications confirming the ability to administer computer networks based on solutions of global software and hardware manufacturers (Microsoft, Cisco Systems). Already during his studies, he will be able to easily find employment (in a local, national and global range) as a designer and creator of teleinformatics and computer networks and a computer network administrator, as well as a specialist in the area of IT security.

BCS Accreditation This degree has been accredited by the British Computing Society (BCS), the chartered institute for information technology (IT). The BCS is committed to making IT good for society. This accreditation is a mark of assurance that the BSc (Hons) Computing degree offered at UCLan Cyprus entitles our graduates to professional membership of the BCS, which is an important part of the criteria for achieving Chartered IT Professional (CITP) status. Some employers recruit preferentially from accredited degrees, and an accredited degree is likely to be recognised by other countries that are signatories to international accords. Career Options A range of careers opens to students upon completion of their degree. These include roles in business requirements analysis, design and development of database-backed systems, development of web and mobile applications, computer games development, system testing and management, wired and wireless networks management, network security, and many more.

Name of the study programme:\u00a0Information technology (Internet of Things) Degree title: Bachelor of Engineering Extent of the study programme: 240 credits City: Kuopio, Finland Mode of teaching: Full-time, on Campus Language: English Application period: January 2023 The Bachelor of Engineering, Information Technology (Internet of Things) programme aims to develop\u00a0experts in information technology with the specialisation in the Internet of Things (IoT).\u00a0The degree programme qualifies engineers to work in the fields of IoT and Big Data; especially, in companies operating within the digital health and industrial internet sectors. The duties of an IoT graduate may vary from software design to electrical engineering, the design of smart wireless devices, and the whole IoT system in the cloud. Our programme incorporates the Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate (CDIO) method to enhance students process of acquiring deep engineering know-how while developing communication, interpersonal, social and teamwork skills. IoT graduates are prepared to work in international environments and teams. Thesis The thesis at Savonia is always work-related. This gives you a good opportunity to network with professionals in your field during your studies, and often the thesis turns out to be a starting point for your career. The thesis emphasises the cooperation between you, working life and the UAS \u2013 from choosing the topic to set the goals and to actually doing it. During the process, you show that you are capable of working independently in recognising, evaluating and solving developmental challenges in working life. Professional reporting and communications skills are required as well. Your work-related thesis can be: a developmental project, which you or your team plan and implement based on the requirements of your client. Examples of such a project include product or service development, technology evaluations and testing, it can be software or hardware weighted, it can consist of the whole information chain from sensors to background system or it can some restricted part. a research-oriented project, where you or your team will perform appropriate research activities in order to shed light on the developmental or problem-solving needs of your client. a compiled thesis, where eg projects, research, development or scientific articles done during the studies are gathered together and reported as a synthesis. Your thesis process will be supported by engineering studies, thesis seminars and methodology workshops. You can do your thesis independently or in a group. Internationality Our BSc -groups are multinational and -cultural by nature, so you will get accustomed to an international work environment from day one. In addition, the BSc programme itself is designed for internationalisation. Close cooperation with our international partners brings you in contact with people and organisations outside Finland, making it possible for you to compare views, share knowledge and work side by side on projects by using technology-based communication tools as well as meeting in person. Student exchange is also a natural and recommended part of your second-year studies, and internships (basic and\/or professional) could take you anywhere in the world. Our selection of language studies is substantial, complemented by the offerings of the University of Eastern Finland. Cross-cultural studies provide a good basis for your personal experiences in all aspects of internationality. Cooperation Savonia is active in developing the surrounding community via, among others, student projects, joint research projects and various development programmes. The cooperation with the local working life is highly valued and based on long-term relationships. Also, the joint activities with the University of Eastern Finland and Karelia UAS bring a variety of options for our students. International aspects are dealt with in a close network of foreign partner institutions, covering exchange, internships, projects and joint or double degrees. Research Our BSc programme is dedicated to helping small and medium-sized businesses in their internationalisation efforts. You will work on various work-related research or developmental projects of SMEs during your studies and gain valuable insight into the industrial or digital health world. Possibilities to continue studies after graduation A BSc degree is an internationally recognized and approved qualification. A BSc graduate is eligible to apply to continue theoretical studies at most universities worldwide. Often the following Master\u2019s degree can be completed in 2 years, depending on the field of study and the student. However, should you wish to continue your studies to the Master level at a university of applied sciences, you will be directed to start your working career to gather 3 years of work experience before entering a Master\u2019s programme. &quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;The BSc Degree Programme at Savonia UAS aims at developing experts in information technology with the specialisation in the Internet of Things.
