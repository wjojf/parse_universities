Electrical and computer engineers have found inspiration to design, build, and test devices that power our everyday world and carry information across the globe. HD TVs, robots and intelligent systems, solar power, computer chips, new computer operating systems \u2013 they all have electrical and computer engineers in common. Tennessee Tech&#039;s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department offers two solid undergraduate programs that emphasize the fundamentals of electrical and computer engineering and enable graduates to enter the workforce with confidence. Programs are offered which lead to Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Engineering (B.S.Cmp.E.) and Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E.), as well as a Mechatronics Concentration in Electrical Engineering (B.S.E.E. - Mechatronics Concentration). Both degree programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http:\/\/www.abet.org. The discipline is divided into several areas within ECE. With about 460 undergraduate students, the department is one of the largest in the College of Engineering. Undergraduate program enrollment and graduation data are on the About the Department page. All 16 faculty members hold doctorates, and one has a joint appointment in one of three Centers of Excellence. These centers have brought the university international recognition and provide unique opportunities for electrical and computer engineering undergraduates to participate in center-related projects. An Exciting Time You&#039;ll have the chance to participate in research that includes wind energy, sending and securing massive amounts of computer data, fuel cells, secure and economical camera surveillance, and more. Many of the great engineering achievements of the 20th century, such as electrification, telephone, radio and television, computers, and medical imaging, were created by electrical and computer engineers. Looking forward, there are several grand challenges in which electrical and computer engineers will contribute to the development of technology to improve the lives of all people. A Solid Foundation You\u2019ll work in labs designed to the replicate experience in the industry. The TVA Power Relay Lab, for instance, has some of the same equipment the industry giant uses in daily operations. There are a number of labs where you can conduct research, even as an undergraduate. A Meaningful Future As a professional, you\u2019ll be experienced in designing and manufacturing safe, economical products that enhance our quality of life. You\u2019ll understand the latest programming languages, operating systems, and software engineering that connect the world. Mobile Device \/ Laptop Computer Recommendations Laptop computers are required for some ECE courses.

Beyond smartphones, computer systems continue to find more and more uses in homes, businesses, and industry through the development of smart devices that are connected to the Internet. Be the person who tackles and solves 21st-century problems by interconnecting these devices and developing the software that controls them. Kansas State Polytechnic\u2019s computer systems technology and Web development technology programs teach you how. Professional options Computer systems technologists are found in organizations of every size and industrial classification. Software developers are employed by companies of all sizes to support the manufacturing, engineering, research and development of new systems. Kansas State Polytechnic has graduates doing this at large corporations, such as Cerner Corporation and Garmin International Inc., as well as many smaller firms. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov) lists software and applications developer in the top 20 occupations for future growth of new jobs. A Web developer is responsible for creating, installing and managing a firm\u2019s web presence. Some graduates are employed by the company directly, others work for web development firms that specialize in creating websites.

Computer software engineers help businesses and other organizations adopt and integrate new technologies and maximize the efficiency of their computer systems. Software engineering emphasizes topics such as software design, software quality assurance, software requirements analysis, software project management, software maintenance, and formal methods for software development. What are the features of Miami\u2019s program? Unique program Miami&#039;s software engineering program is a unique offering in the state of Ohio. Focus on teaching As a university, Miami&#039;s focus is on undergraduate education. This is also true in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, where professors are committed to helping you grow academically and personally. Professors, not graduate assistants, teach all classes that are specifically for software engineering majors. More than half of our professors have been nominated for outstanding teaching awards either by current students or alumni. You will be encouraged to meet with your professors outside of class to discuss class work and professional opportunities. Specialization area Students choose a specialization in a particular application area from such diverse fields as bioinformatics, scientific systems, computer security, e-business systems, and other areas. Related major For both software engineering and computer science, the courses you take the first two years are almost identical. Since you don&#039;t need to choose your major until the end of your sophomore year, you can explore where your interests are strongest. Because so many requirements are the same, it&#039;s also easy to double-major in both software engineering and computer science. Team assignments You&#039;ll learn in a team environment that prepares you for your professional career, where collaborative skills are essential. Work experience On- and off-campus opportunities are available for students to gain practical and professional experience. Benton Information Technology Solutions (BITS) is a student-run technology consulting business providing computer solutions to on- and off-campus clients. Other campus options include research with faculty members and jobs in our computer labs. Students can gain valuable work experience through an internship or co-op job. Miami University\u2019s Career Services Office offers many resources to help students find internships and jobs. There is also a Career Advisor specifically for students in the College of Engineering and Computing who can discuss strategies and resources that may be most relevant to your internship and job search. Top-notch facilities The Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering has a variety of classrooms, labs and learning spaces in Benton Hall. Spaces for students and faculty include 24\/7 lab areas with student commons, the HIVE (a huge immersive virtual environment), additional labs for building and experimenting with software and hardware systems, and rooms for group meetings and team projects.&quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;What is Software Engineering?

The world needs engineers with more than just great technical skills — it needs ethical and visionary leaders. Bucknell&#039;s nationally ranked electrical engineering and computer engineering majors will help you develop personally as you prepare for a career with employers such as Amazon, Lockheed Martin or Accenture — or any job seeking the in-demand skills and experiences you’ll gain. You&#039;ll connect with professors at the top of fields from renewable energy to embedded systems to smart surgical technologies, and build a professional network to last a lifetime. You&#039;ll also find the flexibility to pursue an academic minor, study abroad or play an instrument — and still graduate in four years.
