The program aims to provide a wide range of methodological and technical skills in the field of information engineering in order to create professionals with a high degree of flexibility and adaptation to market demands. It also gives a solid preparation in mathematics and physics, thereby providing the tools and scientific methodologies required to approach engineering problems in a rigorous way. The objectives of the course are therefore: on the one hand, to provide a solid, general scientific and methodological preparation and, on the other hand, to create a highly specialised professional. For this reason, general scientific and engineering methodologies are covered in greater depth (with a view to developing methodological skills in the analysis, modelling and formulation of complex engineering problems), whereas more technically advanced courses are offered to complete the student\u2019s competences presenting methodologies, technical solutions and application in specific sectors. How to study The Internet-based training activities take place in a web-based macro-area which is called the Didactic Cyberspace. In the Didactic Cyberspace, the training and learning process takes place and accesses are diversified through customized login and password based on the role of the players in the educational path: professors, tutors, and students.

<div><save-program :program="{&quot;school_title&quot;:&quot;University of Lincoln&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;BSc (Hons) Games Computing&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The BSc (Hons) Games Computing programme at Lincoln aims to develop the skills and attributes required for roles in the competitive computing sector. The course is designed to help students develop as versatile professionals, capable of thriving in a wide range of post-university employment destinations. Students also have the opportunity to develop skills that lend themselves to the ever-growing, multi-billion pound video games industry. The course aims to develop a skill set that is applicable to the wider spectrum of the digital sector. Beyond learning how to develop software, students can also develop an understanding of the interaction between the computer and its user, and how to design an engaging experience. We aim to produce graduates who can adapt to quickly evolving technology and play key roles within the companies at the forefront of those advances. Beyond how to develop technology, a games computing student can also gain an understanding of how to make it engaging, playful, and fun. The course explores computer science through the specific use-case of games. Students have the opportunity to develop programming skills, alongside specialist modules in topics including games design, 3D graphics, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. The strong conceptual and methodological grounding in both games design and games development gives Lincoln\u2019s Games Computing course a distinctive edge. Students are encouraged to recognise that software engineering is as important as creative design in the success of computer game products and software applications. The course will also explore the role of playful systems beyond the games industry, looking at how games have been applied to sectors such as education and fitness. While our graduates can target careers in the video games industry, their skills may also be applied to a number of different employment pathways, including systems and development roles in the NHS, automotive industry, education sector, and design roles across multiple industries. How You Study In the first year of the degree, students have the opportunity to study fundamental areas, including game design, mathematics for computing, programming, and problem-solving. In the second year, there is in-depth study expected in areas of games computing, such as advanced programming, concept development, user experience design, and artificial intelligence. As well as completing a games development project in the third year, students can choose from a range of specialist optional modules, including Parallel Programming; Autonomous Mobile Robotics; Image Processing; and Virtual and Augmented Reality. Contact Hours Contact hours vary by course and can take many forms, including lectures, seminars, and workshops. A full-time undergraduate student should expect to undertake a minimum of 37 hours of study each week during term-time, supplementing contact hours with independent study. This is an important aspect of university-level education. As a general rule, you will be expected to spend two to three hours working independently for every hour in class. Methods of Assessment The way in which you will be assessed will depend on your chosen course. It may include coursework, written and practical exams, portfolio development, group work, or presentations. A full breakdown of current assessment methods can be found on the individual course pages of this website. The University of Lincoln\u2019s policy is to ensure that staff return assessments to students promptly.

Teaching and Learning During Covid-19 At Lincoln, Covid-19 has encouraged us to review our practices and, as a result, to take the opportunity to find new ways to enhance the student experience. We have made changes to our teaching and learning approach and to our campus, to ensure that students and staff can enjoy a safe and positive learning experience. We will continue to follow Government guidance and work closely with the local Public Health experts as the situation progresses, and adapt our teaching and learning accordingly to keep our campus as safe as possible. Special Features Students have the opportunity to be part of a vibrant community of active researchers and take part in extracurricular activities such as performance and games workshops, game jams, and national competitions. Students have access to a specialist development laboratory, industry-standard software development environments, 3D modeling software and virtual reality systems. Software development environments such as Unreal Engine 4, Unity Pro, and Visual Studio play a major part in the practical elements of the course.
