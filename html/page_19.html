Our UK graduates have gone on to work with major technology companies such as IBM, Google, BBC, and BAE, while others have chosen to take their software design, development and management skills to SMEs, or have set up their own technology-centric businesses. Many of our computer scientists also elect to study for MSc or PhD qualifications. In the first year, you will receive a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles of the discipline, combined with their modern-day application. Throughout your study, you will gain skills and experience from a range of modules, including Software Development, Information Systems, and Digital Systems. Taking a practical approach to learning, you are encouraged to build and analyse systems and software, as well as work with end-user feedback to refine and adapt solutions. After gaining an overview of the subject in the first year, you will be motivated by topics that become progressively deeper and more specialised as your skills develop throughout the second and third year. In addition to progressing your foundational understanding, programming, and software design skills, you will explore social, ethical and professional issues, giving you the experience of computing in the real world.

<div><save-program :program="{&quot;school_title&quot;:&quot;Dominican College&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bachelor in Computer Information Systems&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Dominican College\u2019s program in Computer Information Systems (CIS) will qualify students for career positions in the rapidly growing Information Technology sector. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 13-percent growth rate in the technology field by 2026. This growth rate is about twice the national average for all careers. As a CIS professional, you may work with end-user technology, local area networks, Network Servers, Active Directory, Databases, e-mail systems, cybersecurity, or Internet-based technologies. The CIS program will expose you to all of these areas. The Computer Information Systems field is one of the few where there is a very close connection between the educational requirements and the requirements for careers in the field. In order to bring more real-life work into the classroom, Dominican College has merged the College\u2019s Information Technology Department with the Academic CIS Department. As a result of the merger, the CIS program is kept current based on what is happening in the IT world as technology is continually developing. All students have access to both CIS faculty and IT department professionals as they complete their degrees. Daytime students are offered Work-Study internships in the IT department. This provides more hands-on time repairing and upgrading laptops and desktop computers. There is a dedicated lab for the CIS program that is equipped with commercial-grade hardware and software such as working with real web servers, network servers, database servers, network switches, and routers. Labs and class assignments are based on this hardware. Online students will use software simulators to do the lab work. Our CIS program is based on the current demand for technology skills. We have three courses based on current industry technology certifications, Comp TIA A+, Comp TIA Network+ and Microsoft Server Certification. We highly encourage students to take these certification tests while they are still students or soon after graduation. John Schnobrich \/ Unsplash Summary of Requirements The Computer Information Systems program consists of a minimum of 122 credits, distributed as follows: 60 credits of Liberal Arts 60 credits in Division Requirements 6 credits in divisional requirements 27 credits business requirements 33 credits in CIS Core Courses Admission Requirements for First Year Students Transcripts Ask your high school counselor to forward transcripts directly to the Office of Admissions ACT\/SAT If English is not the first language of the applicant, a minimum TOEFL score of 80 on the internet-based test (I.B.T.), or 550 on the traditional paper test, or 213 on the computer-based test is required for admission. Submit the results of one of the following examinations to the Office of Admissions: Scholastic Aptitude Test (S.A.T.) of the College Entrance Examination Board. The C.E.E.B. Code for Dominican College is 2190. The American College Testing (A.C.T.) Assessment Test. The A.C.T. code for Dominican College is 2730.

Information technology has revolutionized the natural sciences, engineering and medicine; entire new areas, like artificial intelligence, or notions like virtual reality have appeared. Computers and IT are vitally needed in our everyday infrastructure: cars, banking systems and telecommunications. We depend upon these and they have to be designed to work without errors, efficiently and securely. Studying computer science means to understand the principles and functioning of modern computer and software systems, in order to take part in their design and implementation. Computer and software engineering offers an immense variety of challenges and application areas, from developing programs for everyday devices to complex software systems; from applications in biomedical engineering or robotics to inventing new technologies for computer architectures and software development, or understanding human cognition to build truly intelligent systems. At the end of this 4-year full-time programme taught in English you will have the following skills and knowledge: Understanding the fundamentals of exact sciences and engineering applied to computers and information technology Mastering a large body of knowledge in computer science and information technology, becoming familiar with a wide range of application domains and consolidating at least one specialty Identifying, formulating and solving engineering problems using methods and instruments from computer science Using, configuring and administering computer systems and application software Designing, implementing and testing computer equipment and software systems, following a systematic process and using appropriate design tools Experimenting and evaluating solutions adequate with respect to economic and performance requirements Recognizing the economic, ethical, legal and social context of the computer and software engineering profession Acquiring a working style that integrates individual and team abilities, good communication, interdisciplinary and technical cooperation, and continuous professional development. Courses Computer programming Software project management Computer architecture and organization Formal languages and compilers Data structures and algorithms Concurrent and event-based programming Digital circuits and signals Software verification and validation Object-oriented programming Web programming Fundamentals of software engineering Computer network programming Operating systems Device driver design Computer networks Computer security Digital microsystem design Wireless networks and communications Software system design and architecture Microprocessor systems Embedded systems Mobile systems and applications Databases Software quality and evolution Fundamentals of artificial intelligence Multimedia systems Computer graphics and human-computer interaction Assembly language programming Digital telecommunication Data mining Computer and Software Engineering at Politehnica University Timisoara Computers have a long-running tradition in our institution. In 1961, the first electronic computer built in a Romanian university, MECIPT-1 was designed and implemented here, followed by personal computers which were series-produced, such as TiM-S Plus. In 1964, the first students specialized in Electronic Computers; today, there are 1100 students in Computing and Software Engineering, instructed by highly-skilled faculty. Students have access to 25 laboratories with more than 750 computers and dedicated equipment, many outfitted in partnership with IT companies such as Alcatel, Continental, Hella, Lasting, Oc\u00e9. First-hand industrial development experience is available through summer internships, software development groups and laboratory classes held by companies in the Liga AC Labs program of the student league. Students also work with faculty in research projects on mobile systems, robots and sensor networks, reconfigurable hardware, or integrated environments for software analysis. Each year, our students compete individually or in teams in the ACM programming contest or in competitions such as Microsoft excITe and Imagine Cup where they have reached the world finals. The study programme offers the flexibility of specializing by choosing the desired set of courses, and within the Erasmus program, our students can study 1-2 semesters abroad in partner universities. Student organizations such as AIESEC, BEST, Microsoft Student Partners group together students into active teams that get involved offering courses, internships, job fairs, for a richly rewarding student experience. Career opportunities Practically all of our graduates find a job in a very short time, due both to the large set of skills and knowledge acquired during studies, as well as the many opportunities offered by the highly developed IT industry in the area. The presence in Timisoara of large multinational companies has created here a strong pole for the automotive and telecommunication industries. There are also numerous medium-size and small IT companies, as well as a university business incubator which supports graduates and students alike to become local entrepreneurs and create startups pursuing their business ideas. Our graduates have the needed knowledge and skillset required to fill specialty positions demanded by the job market, such as in network or system administration, development of mobile applications (Android\/iOS), development of microcontroller systems, database design and administration, automated and robotic systems, antivirus software, network and software security, digital image and video processing, multimedia systems, distributed software systems, software or hardware project management as team or project leads.

Computer Science&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot; We offer a solid Computer Science education in a Liberal Arts environment. We also integrate into our curriculum real-world experience including our co-operative education program and access to Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects. We are active in several research areas and we offer both a research-intensive or course-based Master\u2019s programme as well as opportunities for undergraduate students to get involved in cutting-edge research. Solid Computer Science Education We offer a solid and complete Computer Science education (Honours, Major, Minor). In addition, we offer interdisciplinary programmes (such as BAIT\/Information Technology), a co-op option, and a number of certificates. Research We are active in a number of research areas, including theoretical computer science, formal software engineering, and image processing. We offer good opportunities for undergraduate students to be involved in cutting-edge research under USRA scholarships or similar. Did you know? Our students have access to various projects thus obtaining real experience by building a substantial software system as part of a team distributed all over Canada. Our co-op education program combines a student\u2019s academic program with integrated work experiences through full-time work terms and regular academic sessions. The work terms are designed to present the students with the opportunity to blend theory and practice and to gain work experience. We are operating in a Liberal Arts environment: It is easy to combine other Majors (particularly Math and Physics) and Minors with your CS degree. Courses &amp;amp; Programs Undergraduate Degree Programs Numerous students have gone forward to graduate studies or to pursue a career after graduation.

<div><save-program :program="{&quot;school_title&quot;:&quot;H-FARM College&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bachelor in Digital Management&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The first Bachelor\u2019s degree in Management dedicated to Digital Management in Italy. Our Bachelor&#039;s Degree in Digital Management is your chance to change your future. Our Mission Prepare a selected group of highly motivated students for the new jobs that firms are offering. Provide them with the new skills that a fast-changing world is demanding. Offer students opportunities to develop new business initiatives. Digital transformation is rapidly changing the economy and the society we live in. It is redefining business models and is radically changing the competitive context in which companies operate. These societal and economic changes affect labor markets and give rise to new jobs and new roles within organizations. It is therefore imperative for universities and business schools to prepare students for these new jobs and roles. This is why Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice in collaboration with H-FARM are offering a new Bachelor\u2019s Degree (BA) in Digital Management. Content This bachelor\u2019s degree course, the first dedicated to Digital Management in Italy, is taught completely in English and provides students with knowledge and skills that are designed to fit the demand of today\u2019s organizations. Courses are highly interdisciplinary and span diverse fields such as management, computer science, economics, and law to deepen the students\u2019 understanding of digital transformation and equip them with the instruments to exploit the opportunities brought about by digital technologies. This course has been designed by Ca\u2019 Foscari University, one of the oldest business schools in Europe, in cooperation with H-FARM Education, the H-FARM&#039;s branch that aims to design and implement academic programs that provide students with the skills needed to face current professional challenges. Learning experience The course will provide students with an innovative learning experience. Projects works, development of soft skills, and interactions with a community of startuppers are unique features in the academic environment. Students have access to a series of curriculum enhancing courses that focus on a variety of topics, from public speaking to project management, from venture capital to social media marketing and much more. Throughout the three-year course, they will learn to assess their personal skill set and to develop their own learning agenda, to acquire knowledge with autonomy, leadership, good judgment, empathy, communication, and negotiation skills. All this will allow students to decipher the needs of a firm and concretely put into practice their technical knowledge in developing innovative entrepreneurial projects. Bootcamps (immersive workshops), company visits, conferences, lectures, and talks by internationally renowned professors, entrepreneurs and top managers contribute to making this Bachelor\u2019s Degree program a truly unique course of study. All this is possible because the degree takes place in the highly innovative environment of the H-CAMPUS, an international hub where students and professionals are guided in a digital transformation process and become informed protagonists of today\u2019s changes. First year In the first year, students will learn the fundamentals of management and its connections with the digital world from both an economic and business standpoint. The aim is to build knowledge of business management principles: accounting and budgeting techniques, microeconomic theory for businesses, mathematical and statistical methods required for digital marketing, and the legal tools to do business in a digital economy. Here are the courses offered in the first year: Mathematics for Decision Sciences Introduction to Digital Management Fundamentals of IT Law Introduction to Economics Probability and Statistics Introduction to Coding and Data Management Students will also have the opportunity to attend the following Curriculum Enhancing Courses: Business English Presentation Design Globalization, Conflict, and Innovation Infographic Public Speaking Writing for Impact Second year In the second year, the focus is on technical and operational skills, both computer-based and managerial ones: e-commerce digital marketing strategies, information security management, and the organization of digital businesses, spanning from the financing of startups to the digital transformation of established businesses. Here are the mandatory courses offered in the second year: Lab of Information System and Analytics E-business, Entrepreneurship and Digital Transformation Planning and Management Control Systems Strategic and Digital Marketing Organizing in a Digital World Business and Digital Law Financing High Growth Firms Students will choose among electives: Lab of Human-Centered Design Data Analytics Digital Public Management and Social Innovation Students will also have the opportunity to attend the following Curriculum Enhancing Courses: Create a Business Plan Social Media and Digital Marketing Project Management Venture Capital Third year The third-year is specifically dedicated to hands-on labs, in areas such as computer security, strategic innovation, interaction design, and software project development. During the second semester, all students will be involved in an internship project in a company or organization in Italy or abroad. The internships will be finalized to develop a specific project based on the company\u2019s needs and will focus on innovation and digital transformation processes, procedures, or work methods. The internship project will also be the core of the student\u2019s final thesis. Here are the courses offered in the first semester of the third year: Economics of innovation, Growth theory and Economic development Network Analysis in Social Science or Lab of computer security Lab of Software Project Development Students will choose among electives: Lab of Web Technologies Business Analytics Financial Statement Analysis Students will also have the opportunity to attend the following Curriculum Enhancing Courses: Tech Disruptions and Innovative Business Model Interaction Design Business Analytics Project Work Social Media Lab Career Through the degree program, students will develop skills that are crucial to start their professional journey. Students have access to a dedicated Career Service and a variety of opportunities to support and prepare them to enter the job market. The services provided are: Career Passport Skills for success Experiential learning Inspirational talks Network Ca&#039; Foscari&#039;s Career Service Application The Bachelor\u2019s Degree course is limited to 105 available spaces.

It&#039;s taught completely in English and provides students with knowledge and skills that are designed to fit the demand of today\u2019s organizations.&quot;,&quot;description_html&quot;:&quot;The first Bachelor\u2019s degree in Management dedicated to Digital Management in Italy. Our Bachelor&#039;s Degree in Digital Management is your chance to change your future. Our Mission Prepare a selected group of highly motivated students for the new jobs that firms are offering. Provide them with the new skills that a fast-changing world is demanding. Offer students opportunities to develop new business initiatives. Digital transformation is rapidly changing the economy and the society we live in. It is redefining business models and is radically changing the competitive context in which companies operate. These societal and economic changes affect labor markets and give rise to new jobs and new roles within organizations. It is therefore imperative for universities and business schools to prepare students for these new jobs and roles. This is why Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice in collaboration with H-FARM are offering a new Bachelor\u2019s Degree (BA) in Digital Management. Content This bachelor\u2019s degree course, the first dedicated to Digital Management in Italy, is taught completely in English and provides students with knowledge and skills that are designed to fit the demand of today\u2019s organizations. Courses are highly interdisciplinary and span diverse fields such as management, computer science, economics, and law to deepen the students\u2019 understanding of digital transformation and equip them with the instruments to exploit the opportunities brought about by digital technologies. This course has been designed by Ca\u2019 Foscari University, one of the oldest business schools in Europe, in cooperation with H-FARM Education, the H-FARM&#039;s branch that aims to design and implement academic programs that provide students with the skills needed to face current professional challenges. Learning experience The course will provide students with an innovative learning experience. Projects works, development of soft skills, and interactions with a community of startuppers are unique features in the academic environment. Students have access to a series of curriculum enhancing courses that focus on a variety of topics, from public speaking to project management, from venture capital to social media marketing and much more. Throughout the three-year course, they will learn to assess their personal skill set and to develop their own learning agenda, to acquire knowledge with autonomy, leadership, good judgment, empathy, communication, and negotiation skills. All this will allow students to decipher the needs of a firm and concretely put into practice their technical knowledge in developing innovative entrepreneurial projects. Bootcamps (immersive workshops), company visits, conferences, lectures, and talks by internationally renowned professors, entrepreneurs and top managers contribute to making this Bachelor\u2019s Degree program a truly unique course of study. All this is possible because the degree takes place in the highly innovative environment of the H-CAMPUS, an international hub where students and professionals are guided in a digital transformation process and become informed protagonists of today\u2019s changes.
