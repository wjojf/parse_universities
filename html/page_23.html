In recent years, UCB&#039;s strategic managers have been aware of the need to gradually consolidate this Department of Informatics, whose importance is constantly increasing while diversifying the training offer in the light of the needs of the Company.

This momentum of consolidation of the existing doubled with the opening of new horizons is only at its beginning because in the medium term, the opening of new Departments (reflections already advanced in favor of Architecture and Construction, software engineering) will allow many families to stop sending their daughters and sons to remote areas and presenting multiform risks for formations that are generally expensive and costly to discuss. In the current phase of its evolution, our faculty therefore contains within it the Department of Computer Science, which trains computer engineers and environmental scientists (again in its first year), which will equip Kivu and the whole Region of its very first generation of scientists trained for the coupling of studies and actions on the environment. Pending the effectiveness of national efforts to successfully link our education system to the LMD system, UCB training lasts another five (5) years, including three (3) years of Graduate and two (2) years of License. To date, the Faculty of Science has already produced 225 computer engineers and patiently awaited the necessary slow maturation of its future first experts in Environmental Sciences. II. MISSION Our mission is to gradually fill the gaps in the Kivu Region, the whole of Congo and its surroundings in highly qualified scientific frameworks with a view to its harmonious development and respecting ethical and environmental values. III. VISION Our Faculty has experienced a palpable dynamism for some years. It intends to conquer, in the medium term, national and international recognition as a framework of excellence for training for development. It will open the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning as well as the Software Engineering option in the near future.

<div><save-program :program="{&quot;school_title&quot;:&quot;Aquinas College&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bachelor in Data Analytics&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot; Starting in fall 2017, Aquinas College will offer a major and minor in Data Analytics, a fast-growing field that prepares students to process and present data in an increasingly data-driven world. Graduates with this major or minor will be able to use mathematical and statistical techniques, combined with programming and software applications to spot trends and other behavior, then present the analysis for wider understanding. This is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, mathematics, computer programming, information technology, and business administration. Advances in technology, such as smartphones, social networking, and e-commerce, in the past five years have been accompanied by an explosion of data. Some experts estimate that over 90% of the world\u2019s data has been created during this period. \u201cAs the practice of data-driven decision making has proliferated across industries, the demand for graduates with the skills required to derive analytical insights from complex data sources has continued to grow,\u201d said Andrew Borgman, a biostatistician at Spectrum Health. \u201cThe Aquinas College Data Analytics Program will provide students with the necessary technical skills and business acumen to tackle today&#039;s challenging problems found at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and business.\u201d More and more, businesses, government agencies, the healthcare industry, research labs, and many other employers are hiring data analysts to help them make sense of their data. Below are some statistics that describe the industry demand for data analysts: A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in 2011 predicted a shortfall in the U.S. of 140,000 \u2013 190,000 people by 2018 with the analytical skills needed to meet the industry\u2019s data analysis needs. The job-search website indeed.com shows that the percentage of jobs with descriptions containing the phrase \u201cbig data analytics\u201d has increased more than four-fold since 2012. In 2015, the International Data Corporation predicted that there would be nearly one million positions in the U.S. by 2018 that require skills in data management and interpretation. Further, salaries for jobs in this field are very competitive. According to datajobs.com, an entry-level data analyst could expect a salary in the range $50,000-$75,000, while the salary range of an experienced data analyst falls between $65,000-$110,000. While the major would provide a foundation in advanced statistical techniques for analyzing data sets, the minor would equip students with a smaller amount of statistics terminology and techniques, an introduction to computer programming and spreadsheet usage and a look at data techniques in the context of other disciplines.

Graduates with this major or minor will be able to use mathematical and statistical techniques, combined with programming and software applications to spot trends and other behavior, then present the analysis for wider understanding. This is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, mathematics, computer programming, information technology, and business administration. Advances in technology, such as smartphones, social networking, and e-commerce, in the past five years have been accompanied by an explosion of data. Some experts estimate that over 90% of the world\u2019s data has been created during this period. \u201cAs the practice of data-driven decision making has proliferated across industries, the demand for graduates with the skills required to derive analytical insights from complex data sources has continued to grow,\u201d said Andrew Borgman, a biostatistician at Spectrum Health. \u201cThe Aquinas College Data Analytics Program will provide students with the necessary technical skills and business acumen to tackle today&#039;s challenging problems found at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and business.\u201d More and more, businesses, government agencies, the healthcare industry, research labs, and many other employers are hiring data analysts to help them make sense of their data. Below are some statistics that describe the industry demand for data analysts: A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in 2011 predicted a shortfall in the U.S. of 140,000 \u2013 190,000 people by 2018 with the analytical skills needed to meet the industry\u2019s data analysis needs. The job-search website indeed.com shows that the percentage of jobs with descriptions containing the phrase \u201cbig data analytics\u201d has increased more than four-fold since 2012. In 2015, the International Data Corporation predicted that there would be nearly one million positions in the U.S. by 2018 that require skills in data management and interpretation. Further, salaries for jobs in this field are very competitive. According to datajobs.com, an entry-level data analyst could expect a salary in the range $50,000-$75,000, while the salary range of an experienced data analyst falls between $65,000-$110,000. While the major would provide a foundation in advanced statistical techniques for analyzing data sets, the minor would equip students with a smaller amount of statistics terminology and techniques, an introduction to computer programming and spreadsheet usage and a look at data techniques in the context of other disciplines. Students with this minor would be in a position to contribute to data analysis solutions in the workplace, to provide insights that could lead to data-driven decisions, and possibly to attend a graduate program in analytics.
