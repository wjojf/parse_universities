Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, measurable approach to building and maintaining software. Starting with thorough preparation in mathematics and computer science, software engineering students at Florida Tech learn how to successfully implement and manage the development, maintenance, and evolution of software products. Whether you want to design dynamic Internet applications, debug embedded software systems, or engineer a new way to protect electronic information, a software engineering degree from Florida Tech develops a strong background in computer science and provides experience in the design and development of software products. Gain Practical Experience Nearly every system in modern society is driven by software. Software engineers work on everything from ATMs to automobiles to tablet computers. Florida Tech\u2019s software engineering degree program prepares students for a career using state-of-the-art computing laboratories, a full suite of software development tools, research projects, internships, and even participation in a student programming team that competes at the ACM Intercollegiate Programming Competition. As a senior, students complete a senior design project in collaboration with their peers to conceptualize, design, and present a novel software application that fulfills a real-world need. Students present their projects to industry leaders and employers and may participate in international competitions. As a result, they get practical experience, an expanded professional network, and perhaps even a pre-graduation job offer. Accreditation The undergraduate software engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. Internationally Recognized Faculty\u2014Personalized Attention Another reason Florida Tech is among the best software engineering colleges is its experienced, internationally recognized professors. These active research scientists have interests in software testing and quality assurance, software evolution, and secure software development, addressing some of the most topical issues in software engineering today. Florida Tech professors are completely accessible to students, actively working with them on their classwork and in research projects. Student programming teams in the department have advanced to the world finals of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC) five times in the past 15 years. The ACM ICPC is often called the \u201cBattle of the Brains,\u201d as it brings together the best student problem-solvers from all over the world\u2014setting Florida Tech apart from other software engineering colleges. Students study in small-sized classes with a student-to-faculty ratio of just 9:1, something not normally found in most software engineering colleges. The close-knit family atmosphere allows students to cultivate an intimate working relationship with fellow students and professors who genuinely care about their success. State-Of-The-Art Facilities\u2014Including Supercomputers! Florida Tech provides several laboratories housed in the F.W. Olin Engineering Complex, a three-story building equipped with innovative technology. Not only do all software engineering students have access to a full suite of software development tools, but they also have access to the Blue shark HPC cluster so they can learn about supercomputers and develop high-performance applications in science and engineering. The department also provides special-purpose laboratories for students working on cutting-edge research projects. Florida Tech is also home to the Harris Institute for Assured Information, an interdisciplinary center devoted to groundbreaking research in computer security and information protection. Located In The Heart Of Florida\u2019s High-Tech Corridor Florida Tech is the perfect place for a BS in Software Engineering. The 130-acre campus is located on the Space Coast (so named because of the presence of NASA and the Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral just north of us), minutes away from the Indian River Lagoon, the most diverse estuary in North America. The area has the fifth-largest high-tech workforce in the country, with more than 5,000 high-tech corporations and government and military organizations located nearby. This workforce also provides an abundance of internship and employment opportunities. Florida Tech is just over the causeway from the Atlantic Ocean with its 72 miles of beautiful beaches, and a short trip to the Florida Keys or the Orlando theme parks. We also have a rich campus life that includes a wide range of intramural and collegiate sports, clubs, and social activities. Build Lasting Professional Relationships Through Campus Organizations Beyond the classroom, students working toward a software engineering degree build leadership and professional experience through exciting internships and participation in academic organizations like Upsilon Pi Epsilon (the computer science honor society), the Computer Gaming Society, student government, and over 100 other student organizations. Our chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery is an award-winning organization that participates in ACM Intercollegiate Programming competitions. ACM also holds weekly tea and cookie parties for networking and making friends. Robotics at Florida Tech (R@FT) also takes part in robotics competitions and challenges, allowing members to utilize skills gained from software engineering internships and research to create real working machines in a team-based environment. Curriculum The software engineering major prepares students for careers as practicing professionals in software architecture, design, implementation, testing, and evolution, or for graduate study. The engineering of software is multidisciplinary, spanning computer science, engineering economics, engineering problem solving, epistemology, human factors management, mathematics, quality control, and safety. The educational objectives of the bachelor of a science degree program are to prepare students so that within a few years after graduation they will be leaders in the development of software where their primary role may be in requirements elicitation, software design, application development, software testing, or software evolution; they will be actively engaged in continual professional development; and will be using their technical knowledge, interpersonal and personal skills and professional attitude to advance their careers, the careers of others and the organizations for which they work.

<div><save-program :program="{&quot;school_title&quot;:&quot;Florida Institute of Technology&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;BS in Computer Science&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;What Is A Computer Science Degree? Computer science focuses on the fundamental theory of computing. Far more than mere programming, computer science encompasses the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking and explores how to design, develop, and test software and information systems. Whether you want to develop new methods of human-computer interaction, design intelligent systems, or program high-powered software applications, a computer science degree from Florida Tech develops a strong background in computer systems with experience in programming and information management. Gain Practical Experience Computer science students at Florida Tech can choose from a variety of sub-fields for their computer science degree including: Artificial intelligence Human-computer interaction Computer architecture Graphics Databases Operating systems Computational science Computer science students learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking and gain the ability to express solutions to problems using computer programming languages. First-year courses for a computer science degree give you a foundation in software development and cover computer organization, allowing you to begin doing computer science on day one. You also take a seminar in computer science disciplines and careers, learn about supercomputers, and develop high-performance applications using our Blueshark HPC cluster (a 576-processor core IBM system). As a senior, you\u2019ll complete a team design project where you&#039;ll conceptualize, design, construct, and present a novel software application. Accreditation The undergraduate computer science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET. Small Classes\u2014Personalized Attention From Internationally Renowned Faculty Florida Tech is known for its small class sizes and low faculty-to-student ratio, creating a tight-knit learning community where professors give individualized attention. Students are often with the same faculty advisor throughout their college experience and find it easy to interact with professors for consultation and mentoring. Because we are one of the top computer science schools, Florida Tech professors provide financial support to about 10% of students through research grants they direct\u2014a true testament to Florida Tech\u2019s student-centered organizational culture. Florida Tech\u2019s faculty are active and internationally known researchers with expertise in computer security, intelligent systems, computer vision, complex networks, and distributed negotiations. Research being done by our faculty involves students in projects related to machine learning, computer vision, biologically inspired computing, data mining, cyber security, cryptography, speech recognition, and more. State-Of-The-Art Facilities Another reason many students choose Florida Tech over other top computer science schools is its high-tech facilities. As indicated by an entrance survey conducted in the last seven years, incoming first-year students list the state-of-the-art F.W. Olin Engineering Complex as one of the top three reasons why they chose to attend Florida Tech. Here, the computing laboratories offer cutting-edge tools for student learning and research. Unlike other top computer science schools you may consider, the computers at Florida Tech are upgraded every three years to ensure they are always capable of running the most up-to-date software, and a full suite of software development tools is freely available to all computer science students. Another reason we&#039;ve earned the distinction among top computer science schools is the Harris Institute for Assured Information, an interdisciplinary center devoted to cutting-edge research in computer security and information protection. Located In The Heart Of Florida\u2019s High-Tech Corridor Florida Tech is the perfect place for a Computer Science degree. The 130-acre campus is located on the Space Coast (so named because of the presence of NASA and the Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral just north of us), minutes away from the Indian River Lagoon, the most diverse estuary in North America. The area has the fifth-largest high-tech workforce in the country, with more than 5,000 high-tech corporations and government and military organizations located nearby. This workforce also provides an abundance of internship and employment opportunities. Florida Tech is just over the causeway from the Atlantic Ocean with its 72 miles of beautiful beaches, and a short trip to the Florida Keys or the Orlando theme parks. We also have a rich campus life that includes a wide range of intramural and collegiate sports, clubs, and social activities. Build Lasting Professional Relationships Through Campus Organizations Beyond the classroom, students earning a computer science degree build leadership and professional experience through exciting participation in academic organizations like Upsilon Pi Epsilon (computer science honor society), student government, or over 100 other student organizations. Outside the classroom, students join the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), a professional student organization that encourages members to network with other computer scientists from around the country. ACM also holds workshops and a \u201cCS Fest\u201d to promote interest in the field. You can also take part in ACM&#039;s Annual International Collegiate Programming Contest. In the last decade, programming teams have consistently placed in the top ten of the southeast region. Florida Tech has advanced to the world finals five times in the past 15 years in what is also referred to as the \u201cBattle of the Brains\u201d because it brings together the best student problem-solvers from all over the world. Members of Florida Tech&#039;s chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (better known as FIT-IEEE) stress the importance of education, networking, research, and friendship during their studies. They also compete in robotics competitions and other team-based projects. Video gamers and science fiction fans can also join the Florida Tech Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy (FITSFF) to take part in gaming competitions, science fiction movie watching nights, and other group activities to make connections with students from other departments with similar interests. Curriculum The curriculum for the computer science major at Florida Tech is a unique and well-rounded program that provides a solid technical background for careers in the computing profession or for graduate studies. Computer science majors study the structure of typical computer systems, the techniques and theories supporting software development, and specialized areas such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, networks, and information management. After graduation, they are equipped to enter the workforce as systems analysts, application and system developers, or software specialists and are provided with the background necessary for graduate study. Students must complete the following minimum course requirements: Freshman Year Fall (16 credit hours) COM 1101 Composition and Rhetoric CSE 1001 Fundamentals of Software Development 1 CSE 1101 Computing Disciplines and Careers 1 CSE 1400 Applied Discrete Mathematics FYE 1000 University Experience MTH 1001 Calculus 1 or\u00a0MTH 1010 Honors Calculus 1 Spring (18 credit hours) COM 1102 Writing About Literature CSE 1002 Fundamentals of Software Development 2 CSE 2120 Computer Organization and Machine Programming MTH 1002 Calculus 2 or\u00a0MTH 1020 Honors Calculus 2 Restricted Elective (laboratory science*) Credit Hours: 4 Sophomore Year Fall (17 credit hours) COM 2223 Scientific and Technical Communication CSE 2010 Algorithms and Data Structures Restricted Elective (laboratory science*) Credit Hours: 4 Select first HUM Core Course: HUM 2051 Civilization 1: Ancient Through Medieval HUM 2141 World Art History 1: Pre-History to Early Global Awareness HUM 2211 British Literature and Culture HUM 2212 British and American Literature 1 HUM 2331 American History: Pre-Columbian to Civil War Era HUM 2551 Survey of Ancient and Medieval Philosophy Select second HUM Core Course: HUM 2052 Civilization 2: Renaissance Through Modern HUM 2142 World Art History 2: Early Modern to Post-Colonial HUM 2212 British and American Literature 1 (may not be repeated for credit) HUM 2213 British and American Literature 2 HUM 2332 American History: From Reconstruction to the Present HUM 2552 Survey of Modern and Contemporary Philosophy Spring (15 credit hours) CSE 2050 Programming in a Second Language CSE 2400 Applied Statistics CSE 2410 Introduction to Software Engineering MTH 3102 Introduction to Linear Algebra Humanities Elective (HU) 3000-level or higher recommended Credit Hours: 3 Junior Year Fall (15 credit hours) CSE 4001 Operating Systems Concepts CSE 4020 Database Systems CSE 4250 Programming Language Concepts Restricted Elective (CSE) Credit Hours: 3 Restricted Elective (MTH or Science) Credit Hours: 3 Spring (16 credit hours) CSE 3100 Junior Project CSE 3120 Computer Architecture and Assembly Programming CSE 3231 Computer Networks CSE 4083 Formal Languages and Automata Theory Restricted Elective (MTH or Science) Credit Hours: 3 Restricted Elective (Social Science) Credit Hours: 3 Senior Year Fall (15 credit hours) CSE 4081 Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms CSE 4101 Computer Science Projects 1 (Q) CSE 4301 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Free Elective Credit Hours: 3 Technical Elective Credit Hours: 3 Spring (15 credit hours) CSE 4102 Computer Science Projects 2 (Q) CSE 4232 Computer Network Programming CSE 4251 Compiler Theory Free Elective Credit Hours: 3 Restricted Electives (CSE) Credit Hours: 3 Total Credits Required: 127 *Students select one laboratory science sequence (BIO 1010 Biological Discovery 1 and BIO 1030 Introduction to Biotechnology \/BIO 1020 Biological Discovery 2 and BIO 1040 Introduction to Biodiversity and Physiology, CHM 1101 General Chemistry 1\/CHM 1102 General Chemistry 2, or PHY 1001 Physics 1\/PHY 2091 Physics Laboratory 1 and PHY 2002 Physics 2\/PHY 2092 Physics Laboratory 2).

Florida Tech is listed among the Fiske Guide&#039;s \u201cEngineering\/Top Technical Institutes\u201d and Parade Magazine\u2019s \u201cCollege A-List in Engineering.\u201d Because of the school\u2019s focus on integrated lab experiences, internships, peer-group study, and faculty-led or international research opportunities, students who seek a computer engineering degree from Florida Tech demonstrate through practical application their mastery of the curriculum and are able to enter a variety of competitive career fields. Seniors take courses in computer architecture, virtual instrumentation, and Internet programming. This includes a design project in collaboration with a team of peers who design, develop, prototype, and present a complex engineering system. Additionally, graduates with a computer engineering degree can design complex computer systems. As a result, students get practical experience, an expanded professional network, and perhaps even a pre-graduation job offer. World-Renowned Faculty, And One-On-One Attention As one of the top computer engineering schools in the country, Florida Tech\u2019s academic environment fosters innovation and exploration. Florida Tech boasts small classes and low student-to-faculty ratios, with most classes taught by PhD-level professors whose greatest interest is helping students succeed. Because of our small classes, Florida Tech professors can offer students personalized attention and are easily accessible for assistance and advice. We have a diverse faculty with specialties in a variety of areas who are active in teaching and research and occupy important roles in professional organizations. Many of our faculty members have won Florida Tech teaching and research awards served on national and international committees and worked with institutions around the world. Our faculty includes an IEEE Fellow, an IEEE Life Fellow, a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, and a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Signal and Imaging Systems Engineering. Accreditation The undergraduate computer engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. State-Of-The-Art Facilities Another advantage Florida Tech may have over other top computer engineering schools is its facilities. The F.W. Olin Engineering Complex epitomizes Florida Tech&#039;s commitment to academic excellence and cutting-edge technology. This state-of-the-art facility provides students with an outstanding learning environment. The complex has three levels linked by the latest electronic and communications technology, a 142-seat multimedia auditorium, and 26 specialized research and teaching laboratories, all supporting multiple departments within the College of Engineering. Located In The Heart Of Florida\u2019s High-Tech Corridor Florida Tech is the perfect place for a computer engineering degree. The 130-acre campus is located on the Space Coast (so named because of the presence of NASA and the Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral just north of us), minutes away from the Indian River Lagoon, the most diverse estuary in North America. The area has the fifth-largest high-tech workforce in the country, with more than 5,000 high-tech corporations and government and military organizations located nearby. This workforce also provides an abundance of internship and employment opportunities. Florida Tech is just over the causeway from the Atlantic Ocean with its 72 miles of beautiful beaches, and a short trip to the Florida Keys or the Orlando theme parks. We also have a rich campus life that includes a wide range of intramural and collegiate sports, clubs, and social activities. Build Lasting Professional Relationships Through Campus Organizations In addition to research and computer engineering internships, students can join professional organizations: Florida Tech&#039;s student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (known as FIT-IEEE) competes in robotics competitions and professional conferences. Eta Kappa Nu is an honor society designed to recognize engineering and computer sciences, students, for outstanding academic achievements during their time at Florida Tech. High-achieving students may also become members of Tau Beta Pi, a national engineering honor society. Students can also participate in student government or over 100 other student organizations on campus. Curriculum The goal of the computer engineering major is to provide the student with a total learning experience. The program is designed to expose the entire spectrum of computer engineering concepts from the basic building blocks of transistors and gates, through the progression of embedded controllers, computer architectures, and high-performance digital signal processors. Computer engineering majors develop an extensive knowledge of hardware, along with a strong education in programming techniques to provide them with a complete understanding of computer systems. In the senior year, the design, build and test computer systems as part of their senior design course. The educational objectives for computer engineering are to produce graduates who will establish themselves as practicing professionals who will engage in advanced studies in engineering or a related field; display awareness of the importance of opportunities for lifelong learning; excel in the global marketplace, and demonstrate the ability to work successfully as members of professional teams and function effectively as responsible professionals. A major component of the computer engineering major at Florida Tech involves hands-on learning. The computer engineering student begins taking computer engineering courses during the freshman year. The freshman-level courses include programming and interfacing an embedded microcontroller. Laboratory experience is integrated into most of our classes. In the junior year, students are introduced to interfacing with a high-performance digital signal processor. In computer engineering, a strong focus is on the mastery principle. It is assumed that computer engineering students not only know the material critical to engineering but also can demonstrate mastery of the material, which is the goal of everyone in the program. During the freshman and sophomore years, students learn the basics of computer engineering along with college-level mathematics and physics. In addition, courses in computer design with hands-on laboratory experience are taken both terms of the freshman year. In these courses, students program and create an interface to an embedded microcontroller. Throughout the sophomore and junior years, students learn basic analytical techniques of the engineer\u2014ways in which the engineer views physical situations and uses mathematical techniques to design basic subsystems. Many of the courses taken by students at this level offer integrated laboratory experiences. In this way, students can visualize the practical aspects of the various theories they encounter. During the senior year, students continue to build their knowledge base to develop a systematic approach to engineering design. Through electives that emphasize applications using digital signal processors, students may explore various topics within computer engineering for which they have developed specific interests.
