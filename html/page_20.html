The C.I.S. curriculum combines aspects of history, sociology, psychology, communication, art, design, science, and mathematics. The program stresses problem-solving and effective communication skills while addressing issues in computational thinking, visual culture, interaction design, information management and analysis, systems development, and security. Students select from a range of electives while continuing a course of study that provides a solid grounding in effective coding and production, as well as user-focused design and interaction, and formal modeling and analysis. The major and minor in C.I.S. have been designed to give students a strong background in a breadth of approaches to computing. Students with an interest in a particular subfield of computing are encouraged to consider an emphasis to the C.I.S. major. The Big Data emphasis is an analog to the Computational Science concentration for C.I.S. majors and focuses on the use of computer modeling, visualization, and analysis over large data sets to solve complex problem-solving tasks. The Computer Science emphasis is designed for students intending to pursue graduate work focused on the foundational and theoretical underpinnings of the computing sciences. The Digital Media emphasis stresses visual literacy and creative problem solving and focuses on how people communicate meaning through innovative contexts capitalizing on various digital media. The Interaction Design emphasis highlights the issues involved in designing computing systems in a human-centric manner and focuses on the theories and techniques involved in developing effective interfaces for information systems. The Web and Mobile Technologies emphasis is designed for students with an intended career path in web and mobile application development and focuses on both design issues and production and implementation issues central to delivering content through these media. Students majoring in other fields wishing to develop technical skills to complement their studies are encouraged to consider a concentration associated with the program, such as Environmental Studies; Graphic Design; Computational Science; or Professional Writing. The C.I.S. major and minor are associated with the Department of Computing and Information Studies. A major requires 11 courses and a minor requires six. Advice on Choosing C.I.S. Courses In Computing and Information Studies there are many possible starting courses - it is more important that students start with a course they are interested in than look at the course number. C.I.S. also has a number of offerings that are excellent complements to the other majors on campus. We hope all students will think about how learning about computing could help them academically and professionally and consider taking a course during their four years at the college.&quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;The Computing and Information Studies program has the dual mission of preparing students to take a leadership role in information technology, independent of the career or graduate education paths they pursue and of contributing to the interdisciplinary uses of information technology across the Washington &amp; Jefferson Curriculum.&quot;,&quot;description_html&quot;:&quot;The Computing and Information Studies program has the dual mission of preparing students to take a leadership role in information technology, independent of the career or graduate education paths they pursue and of contributing to the interdisciplinary uses of information technology across the Washington &amp;amp; Jefferson Curriculum.

Graduates of this program will possess the practical knowledge and skill of a defined engineering approach for complex systems analysis, planning, design, and construction. The coursework builds upon computer science fundamentals and mathematical principles to cover the design, analysis, verification, validation, implementation, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. There is often confusion regarding the differences between computer science, software engineering and IT\/IS. The following diagram from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) provides insight into the relationship between each of the areas. Electrical Engineers (EE) are primarily involved with hardware design, while Computer Engineers (CE) design systems that include both hardware and software. Computer Science (CS) covers the concepts and technology involved with how to make a computer do something (graphics, robotics, etc.), and software engineering (SE) focuses on how to design and build software. There is significant overlap between computer science and software engineering and the intersection between the two is often programming; however, there is a key difference. Computer scientists test theories and work at the edge of the unknown. Software engineering is an engineering discipline. Engineering starts with the knowledge that has already been proven reliable and develops solutions for technical, societal and commercial problems. Information Technology (IT) and Information Services (IS) are focused on delivering technology solutions to an organization. The Snow College Software Engineering program provides students with an educational experience that builds upon traditional computer science and engineering and produces software engineers that create high-quality software in a systematic, controlled, and efficient manner. This is accomplished in the following ways: - The degree has a strong emphasis on mathematics and use of engineering methods in software design. - Courses place an emphasis on software processes and lifecycles and utilize a team approach to building software with active learning (\u201clearning by doing\u201d) which also provides leadership opportunities, such as software development team lead roles, for every student. - Courses include significant learning in management areas such as project planning, resource allocation, quality assurance, testing, metrics, maintenance and troubleshooting, configuration management and personnel management. - Courses incorporate student teams to work on activities specifically designed to guide students to collaboratively construct their own understanding of key concepts, and, at the same time develop key process skills like communication, teamwork, critical thinking and problem-solving. - Students will have a choice of an emphasis in: Entrepreneurship: The combination of computational and entrepreneurial thinking to identify, assess and implement ideas that will create new markets and technologies. Digital Media Design: The use of integrated media to communicate messages through electronic mediums such as the Internet, film, television and mobile technologies. Web Development: The use of tools including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and maintain high quality, interactive websites. The software engineering curriculum culminates in a year-long capstone sequence where the students work in teams to build a software system reflective of current practices in the industry. Additionally, students are encouraged to participate in internships prior to and during enrollment in these capstone courses in order to gain direct industry experience and insight before embarking upon their own projects. Snow College will be partnering with businesses to develop these learning opportunities that will provide students with industry relevant experience. The Snow College Software Engineering program prepares students to enter the software engineering profession immediately or to go on to pursue advanced educational opportunities. The first two years of the program are also compatible with transfer to an institution offering a degree in computer science.

Earnings for Software Engineers According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a typical starting salary is around $70,000 and most software engineering careers pay between $80,000 and $105,000 per year. Earning potential varies by location, experience, education, industry, employer, and certification. Skills needed for Software Engineering Software engineering professionals are skill-based, requiring highly specialized training in both technical and non-technical areas. Employers seek candidates who possess a blend of technical and soft skills. Soft skills valued by employers include communication, organization, project management, problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision making. Beyond soft skills, software engineers also develop both technical and industry-specific skill sets that are applicable to all careers in computer engineering and specific areas of practice, respectively. Example technical skills include programming languages, computer hardware and software, and system architecture. Preparing for a career in Software Engineering 1) Earn a degree in software engineering or a related field. Most software engineer positions require a bachelor\u2019s degree. Majoring in software engineering will provide the most useful background for designing and perfecting software. To prepare for your career, here are some things you can do. 2) Begin programming immediately. Even if you\u2019re still in grade school, you can give yourself a huge head start by teaching yourself programming. Software engineering is not focused exclusively on coding, but you will need to know at least a couple of languages, and a deeper understanding of how they function. There is no widespread agreement on which languages are most useful, but these are all popular choices: C++ C# Java JavaScript Python 3) Study math. Software engineers sometimes create the mathematical algorithms that allow software to function. Focus on developing and maintaining your math skills in order to do your best once you\u2019ve obtained a position as a software engineer. 4) Build software. The best way to improve your skills is to use them. Whether professional projects or personal, designing and coding software will teach you a great deal. For many employers, hands-on achievements matter more than GPA or theoretical knowledge. 5) Seek an internship. Many software engineering students work as interns while they complete their studies. This can be an excellent way to gain hands-on training and network with potential employers 6) Consider your career goals. The software industry is always changing. Continually improve your knowledge and practical skills. Join a professional organization like ACM or IEEE for networking opportunities. Pursue certifications relevant to your field of interest. See Snow tiers for opportunities to start your software engineering pathway. Available Professional Certifications There are a variety of certifications you can seek to demonstrate your skill with particular languages, products, or job roles. Some reflect broad knowledge, others focus on narrow skills in specialized areas. Application engineers with broad knowledge may want to pursue credentials through the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE Society\u2019s software development credentials reflect the knowledge in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge Guide (SWEBOK). They are internationally recognized.&quot;,&quot;description_short&quot;:&quot;The Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering degree prepares software engineers: collaborative professionals working on a team to develop software products on time, within budget, and those meet customer requirements.&quot;,&quot;description_html&quot;:&quot; Software Engineering The Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering degree prepares software engineers: collaborative professionals working on a team to develop software products on time, within budget, and those meet customer requirements.

If you are a computer science major, you will see this in many forms\u2013the study of algorithms, of machine hardware, of programming languages, operating systems, database design, and more. The career opportunities are equally varied\u2013software engineer, database manager, network administrator, project manager, and many others. The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, predicts that for 2006\u20132016, three of the six occupations that will be among the fastest growing and register the largest numerical growth will be computing-related occupations. Because computers are so pervasive, a computer science degree gives you the opportunity to make an impact in the world of science, business, healthcare, education, the law, art, entertainment, or almost anything else that interests you. Even if you are not a computer science major, taking computer science courses will improve your logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Mission The mission of the Computer Science Department is to: Educate computer science majors in a rigorous B.S. degree program so that graduates are prepared to enter high-quality technical professional positions or go on to graduate programs Provide computer education that serves the needs of various student components of the University Goals for Student Learning in the Major The Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science is designed to prepare students for success as computer science professionals. Students graduating from this program should be able to apply their knowledge to a specific design problem, including detailing the specifications, analyzing the problem, and providing a design and implementation that functions as desired, while meeting criteria for performance, reliability, maintainability, and cost. A broad background in the humanities and social sciences, together with a course emphasizing professional ethics, provides students a basis for understanding the societal implications of work performed in their chosen profession. Students finishing this program should also be prepared for graduate studies in computer science. Special Features of the Computer Science Program Computer Science at UH Hilo offers you small class sizes, very available faculty who take a great interest in student success, opportunities for team experiences, and a strong sense of community among the upper-division students. Students in this program generally score above the national average on the Major Field Achievement Test in Computer Science, and graduates are employed by major companies in Hawai\u02bbi and on the mainland. The year-long software engineering sequence, CS 460-461 Software Engineering I (3), Software Engineering II (3), provides a project-based capstone experience that draws on the knowledge and skills made available from previous courses and emphasizes the teamwork needed to solve real-world problems. The Department also offers a number of courses designed for non-computer-science majors: CS 100 Prin Of Computer Sci (3), CS 101 Digital Tools for Info World (3), CS 102 MS Office Tools for Math &amp;amp; Sci (3)\/MATH 111 MS Office Tools for Math &amp;amp; Sci (3), CS 130 Beg Graphics, Game Programg (3), CS 135 Animation Programming (3), CS 137 Digital Media with Flash (3), CS 200-201 Web Technology I (3), Web Technology II (3), and CS 300 Web Site Management (3). These courses are heavily laboratory-oriented, giving students considerable hands-on experience. In order to assist students in mastering the technologies they encounter in these courses, the Department has developed a number of learning aids, including specialized laboratory manuals, specialized software, audio-visual tutorial files, and carefully structured laboratory exercises. The UH Hilo Computer Science Department occupies three labs, two classrooms, a network administrative office, and several nearby faculty offices. All laboratory and office workstations are part of a local area network and also have high-speed Internet connections. All workstations are set up with connections to both the department\u2019s Windows servers and Linux servers, as instructional and research needs require.
