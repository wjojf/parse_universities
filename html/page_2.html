You can choose from: ICT &amp;amp; Business ICT &amp;amp; Software Engineering ICT &amp;amp; Technology ICT &amp;amp; Media design ICT &amp;amp; Infrastructure After the second semester next to your chosen study programme you will choose 1 or 2 exciting specialisations. These specialisations cover the latest developments in ICT. Fontys ICT has developed intensive cooperation with more than 110 leading ICT companies in the region. This cooperation results in the latest ICT developments and if required leading to new specialisations. So that you are sure that your ICT study programme is always up to date and fits in well with what employers expect from you as an ICT graduate. Bachelor of ICT &amp;amp; Business Nowadays Business processes make use of ICT more and more and Business IT-specialists know how to apply ICT in organisations to achieve their objectives. A Business IT-specialist knows how to analyze organisations and business processes but is also able to give advice on solutions and transfer these solutions into the design and \u2013 also important \u2013 to implement their designs. Business Information Technology is a wide study field focussed on business processes and how to improve these processes by using ICT and also to make them quicker, cheaper and more client-friendly. A Business IT-specialist can build bridges and knows how to cooperate and communicate: with management and the clients to find out what the organisation is looking for. This means working together with ICT-developers who realise the solutions developed by the Business IT-specialist and the users who have to work with them. This programme leads to the International Bachelor of Science degree (BSc) in Information &amp;amp; Communication Technology (CROHO: HBO-ICT). Our students are trained to become all-around IT-experts in Business Information Technology. With the knowledge and skills obtained at Fontys University, students can work as high-level Information System Analysts and managers in the IT sector. Bachelor of ICT &amp;amp; Software Engineering This programme is all about designing, developing and maintaining software for all kind of applications. You will learn to translate the requirements from clients into a software design and implement the software design with a programming language (e.g. in C#. Subjects you will study are Object-Oriented Development, Operating Systems, Client-Server Applications, System Development, Networking, web applications, mobile programming. Bachelor of ICT &amp;amp; Technology Nowadays you will find software in almost every device, from a television to a heart-defibrillator and from a watch to an elevator. Within our bachelor programme ICT &amp;amp; Technology, we focus on writing software for all these devices. We will train you to become an expert in software development, especially in the so-called Embedded Software. Subjects you will study are e.g: Embedded Software, web applications, sensors &amp;amp; actuators, C\/C#, Operating Systems, Client-Server Applications, Mobile Programming. Bachelor of ICT &amp;amp; Media design ICT &amp;amp; Media Design is about the design and development of the relation and interaction between humans and media technology.
